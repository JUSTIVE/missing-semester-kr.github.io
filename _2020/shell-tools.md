이번 강의에선, 배시(bash)를 스크립팅 언어로 사용하는 기본 사항들과 여러분들이 앞으로 명령줄에서 가장 보편적인 작업을 할 때 사용되는 몇개의 셸 도구들에 대해서 소개할 것입니다.

# 셸(Shell) 스크립팅

지난 시간에 셸에서 명령들을 추출하고 파이프로 연결시키는 방법에 대해서 배웠습니다. 그러나 많은 상황에선 일련의 명령을 수행하고 조건문이나 반복문과 같은 제어 흐름 표현식을 사용해야 하는 경우가 있습니다.

쉘 스크립트은 살짝 복잡합니다. 대부분의 셸에는 변수, 제어 흐름(control flow) 및 자체 구문(syntax)을 가진 자체 스크립팅 언어가 있습니다. 쉘 스크립트와 다른 프로그래밍 언어와의 차이점은 쉘 관련 작업을 수행하기 위해 최적화되어 있다는 것입니다. 따라서 명령 파이프 라인을 만들고 파일을 저장하고 표준 입력을 받는 것은 쉘 스크립팅이 원시적이며 범용 스크립팅 언어보다 사용하기 쉽습니다. 이 섹션에서는 그 중 가장 일반적인 배시(bash) 스크립팅에 중점을 둘 것입니다.

배시에서 변수에 값을 할당할 때는 `foo=bar`와 같이  입력합니다. 변수의 값에 접근할 때는 `$foo`로 액세스합니다. `foo = bar`와 같이 띄어쓰기를 사용하면 `=` 와 `bar`를 사용하여 `foo` 프로그램을 호출하는 것으로 해석되므로 작동하지 않습니다. 일반적으로 셸 스크립트에서 공간 문자는 인수 분할을 수행합니다. 이런 규칙은 일반적인 프로그래밍 언어와 다르기 때문에 헷갈릴 수가 있으니 항상 유의하세요.

배시에서 문자열은 `'`나 `"` 기호로 선언 될 수 있지만 다른 의미를 가지게 됩니다. `'`로 둘러싸인 문자열은 문자열 자체를 뜻하지만  `"`로 둘러싸인 문자열은 변수값을 반환합니다.
```bash
foo=bar
echo "$foo"
# prints bar
echo '$foo'
# prints $foo
```

대부분의 프로그래밍 언어와 마찬가지로, 배시는 `if`, `case`, `while` 및 `for`를 포함한 제어 흐름 기술을 지원합니다. 마찬가지로, 배시는 인자를 만들고 사용하고 작동하는 기능들이 있습니다. 다음은 디렉토리를 만들고 `cd`를 수행하는 함수의 예시입니다.
```bash
mcd () {
    mkdir -p "$1"
    cd "$1"
}
```

`$1`은 script/function의 첫 번째 인자입니다. 다른 스크립팅 언어와 달리, bash는 인수, 오류 코드 및 기타 관련 변수를 참조하기 위해 다양한 특수 변수를 사용합니다. 아래에 그 중 일부를 적어놨습니다. 더 포괄적인 목록은 [여기](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html)서 찾을 수 있습니다.

- `$0` - 스크립트 이름
- `$1` ~ `$9` - 스크립트의 인자들. `$1`부터 첫번쨰 인자입니다.
- `$@` - 모든 인자들
- `$#` - 인자의 수
- `$?` - 이전 명령을 반환하는 코드
- `$$` - 현재 스크립트에 대한 프로세스 식별 번호 (PID)
- `!!` - 인수를 포함하여 마지막 명령 전체를 포함합니다. 일반적으로는 사용 권한이 누락되어 실패할 때 사용합니다. `sudo`를 함께 써서 실패한 명령을 신속하게 다시 실행할 수 있습니다.
- `$_` - 마지막 명령에서 나온 마지막 인수입니다. 대화형 셸에 있는 경우 `Esc`를 입력한 후 `.`을 입력해 이 값을 신속하게 얻을 수 있습니다.

Commands will often return output using `STDOUT`, errors through `STDERR`, and a Return Code to report errors in a more script-friendly manner.
The return code or exit status is the way scripts/commands have to communicate how execution went.
A value of 0 usually means everything went OK; anything different from 0 means an error occurred.

Exit codes can be used to conditionally execute commands using `&&` (and operator) and `||` (or operator), both of which are [short-circuiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) operators. Commands can also be separated within the same line using a semicolon `;`.
The `true` program will always have a 0 return code and the `false` command will always have a 1 return code.
Let's see some examples

```bash
false || echo "Oops, fail"
# Oops, fail

true || echo "Will not be printed"
#

true && echo "Things went well"
# Things went well

false && echo "Will not be printed"
#

true ; echo "This will always run"
# This will always run

false ; echo "This will always run"
# This will always run
```

Another common pattern is wanting to get the output of a command as a variable. This can be done with _command substitution_.
Whenever you place `$( CMD )` it will execute `CMD`, get the output of the command and substitute it in place.
For example, if you do `for file in $(ls)`, the shell will first call `ls` and then iterate over those values.
A lesser known similar feature is _process substitution_, `<( CMD )` will execute `CMD` and place the output in a temporary file and substitute the `<()` with that file's name. This is useful when commands expect values to be passed by file instead of by STDIN. For example, `diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)` will show differences between files in dirs  `foo` and `bar`.


Since that was a huge information dump, let's see an example that showcases some of these features. It will iterate through the arguments we provide, `grep` for the string `foobar`, and append it to the file as a comment if it's not found.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting program at $(date)" # Date will be substituted

echo "Running program $0 with $# arguments with pid $$"

for file in $@; do
    grep foobar $file > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
    # When pattern is not found, grep has exit status 1
    # We redirect STDOUT and STDERR to a null register since we do not care about them
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo "File $file does not have any foobar, adding one"
        echo "# foobar" >> "$file"
    fi
done
```

In the comparison we tested whether `$?` was not equal to 0.
Bash implements many comparisons of this sort - you can find a detailed list in the manpage for [`test`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/test.1.html).
When performing comparisons in bash, try to use double brackets `[[ ]]` in favor of simple brackets `[ ]`. Chances of making mistakes are lower although it won't be portable to `sh`. A more detailed explanation can be found [here](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031).

When launching scripts, you will often want to provide arguments that are similar. Bash has ways of making this easier, expanding expressions by carrying out filename expansion. These techniques are often referred to as shell _globbing_.
- Wildcards - Whenever you want to perform some sort of wildcard matching, you can use `?` and `*` to match one or any amount of characters respectively. For instance, given files `foo`, `foo1`, `foo2`, `foo10` and `bar`, the command `rm foo?` will delete `foo1` and `foo2` whereas `rm foo*` will delete all but `bar`.
- Curly braces `{}` - Whenever you have a common substring in a series of commands, you can use curly braces for bash to expand this automatically. This comes in very handy when moving or converting files.

```bash
convert image.{png,jpg}
# Will expand to
convert image.png image.jpg

cp /path/to/project/{foo,bar,baz}.sh /newpath
# Will expand to
cp /path/to/project/foo.sh /path/to/project/bar.sh /path/to/project/baz.sh /newpath

# Globbing techniques can also be combined
mv *{.py,.sh} folder
# Will move all *.py and *.sh files


mkdir foo bar
# This creates files foo/a, foo/b, ... foo/h, bar/a, bar/b, ... bar/h
touch {foo,bar}/{a..h}
touch foo/x bar/y
# Show differences between files in foo and bar
diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)
# Outputs
# < x
# ---
# > y
```

<!-- Lastly, pipes `|` are a core feature of scripting. Pipes connect one program's output to the next program's input. We will cover them more in detail in the data wrangling lecture. -->

Writing `bash` scripts can be tricky and unintuitive. There are tools like [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) that will help you find errors in your sh/bash scripts.

Note that scripts need not necessarily be written in bash to be called from the terminal. For instance, here's a simple Python script that outputs its arguments in reversed order:

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python
import sys
for arg in reversed(sys.argv[1:]):
    print(arg)
```

The kernel knows to execute this script with a python interpreter instead of a shell command because we included a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) line at the top of the script.
It is good practice to write shebang lines using the [`env`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/env.1.html) command that will resolve to wherever the command lives in the system, increasing the portability of your scripts. To resolve the location, `env` will make use of the `PATH` environment variable we introduced in the first lecture.
For this example the shebang line would look like `#!/usr/bin/env python`.

Some differences between shell functions and scripts that you should keep in mind are:
- Functions have to be in the same language as the shell, while scripts can be written in any language. This is why including a shebang for scripts is important.
- Functions are loaded once when their definition is read. Scripts are loaded every time they are executed. This makes functions slightly faster to load, but whenever you change them you will have to reload their definition.
- Functions are executed in the current shell environment whereas scripts execute in their own process. Thus, functions can modify environment variables, e.g. change your current directory, whereas scripts can't. Scripts will be passed by value environment variables that have been exported using [`export`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/export.1p.html)
- As with any programming language, functions are a powerful construct to achieve modularity, code reuse, and clarity of shell code. Often shell scripts will include their own function definitions.

# Shell Tools

## Finding how to use commands

At this point, you might be wondering how to find the flags for the commands in the aliasing section such as `ls -l`, `mv -i` and `mkdir -p`.
More generally, given a command, how do you go about finding out what it does and its different options?
You could always start googling, but since UNIX predates StackOverflow, there are built-in ways of getting this information.

As we saw in the shell lecture, the first-order approach is to call said command with the `-h` or `--help` flags. A more detailed approach is to use the `man` command.
Short for manual, [`man`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html) provides a manual page (called manpage) for a command you specify.
For example, `man rm` will output the behavior of the `rm` command along with the flags that it takes, including the `-i` flag we showed earlier.
In fact, what I have been linking so far for every command is the online version of the Linux manpages for the commands.
Even non-native commands that you install will have manpage entries if the developer wrote them and included them as part of the installation process.
For interactive tools such as the ones based on ncurses, help for the commands can often be accessed within the program using the `:help` command or typing `?`.

Sometimes manpages can provide overly detailed descriptions of the commands, making it hard to decipher what flags/syntax to use for common use cases.
[TLDR pages](https://tldr.sh/) are a nifty complementary solution that focuses on giving example use cases of a command so you can quickly figure out which options to use.
For instance, I find myself referring back to the tldr pages for [`tar`](https://tldr.ostera.io/tar) and [`ffmpeg`](https://tldr.ostera.io/ffmpeg) way more often than the manpages.


## Finding files

One of the most common repetitive tasks that every programmer faces is finding files or directories.
All UNIX-like systems come packaged with [`find`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html), a great shell tool to find files. `find` will recursively search for files matching some criteria. Some examples:

```bash
# Find all directories named src
find . -name src -type d
# Find all python files that have a folder named test in their path
find . -path '**/test/**/*.py' -type f
# Find all files modified in the last day
find . -mtime -1
# Find all zip files with size in range 500k to 10M
find . -size +500k -size -10M -name '*.tar.gz'
```
Beyond listing files, find can also perform actions over files that match your query.
This property can be incredibly helpful to simplify what could be fairly monotonous tasks.
```bash
# Delete all files with .tmp extension
find . -name '*.tmp' -exec rm {} \;
# Find all PNG files and convert them to JPG
find . -name '*.png' -exec convert {} {.}.jpg \;
```

Despite `find`'s ubiquitousness, its syntax can sometimes be tricky to remember.
For instance, to simply find files that match some pattern `PATTERN` you have to execute `find -name '*PATTERN*'` (or `-iname` if you want the pattern matching to be case insensitive).
You could start building aliases for those scenarios, but part of the shell philosophy is that it is good to explore alternatives.
Remember, one of the best properties of the shell is that you are just calling programs, so you can find (or even write yourself) replacements for some.
For instance, [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is a simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to `find`.
It offers some nice defaults like colorized output, default regex matching, and Unicode support. It also has, in my opinion, a more intuitive syntax.
For example, the syntax to find a pattern `PATTERN` is `fd PATTERN`.

Most would agree that `find` and `fd` are good, but some of you might be wondering about the efficiency of looking for files every time versus compiling some sort of index or database for quickly searching.
That is what [`locate`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/locate.1.html) is for.
`locate` uses a database that is updated using [`updatedb`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/updatedb.1.html).
In most systems, `updatedb` is updated daily via [`cron`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html).
Therefore one trade-off between the two is speed vs freshness.
Moreover `find` and similar tools can also find files using attributes such as file size, modification time, or file permissions, while `locate` just uses the file name.
A more in-depth comparison can be found [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60205/locate-vs-find-usage-pros-and-cons-of-each-other).

## Finding code

Finding files by name is useful, but quite often you want to search based on file *content*. 
A common scenario is wanting to search for all files that contain some pattern, along with where in those files said pattern occurs.
To achieve this, most UNIX-like systems provide [`grep`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html), a generic tool for matching patterns from the input text.
`grep` is an incredibly valuable shell tool that we will cover in greater detail during the data wrangling lecture.

For now, know that `grep` has many flags that make it a very versatile tool.
Some I frequently use are `-C` for getting **C**ontext around the matching line and `-v` for in**v**erting the match, i.e. print all lines that do **not** match the pattern. For example, `grep -C 5` will print 5 lines before and after the match.
When it comes to quickly searching through many files, you want to use `-R` since it will **R**ecursively go into directories and look for files for the matching string.

But `grep -R` can be improved in many ways, such as ignoring `.git` folders, using multi CPU support, &c.
Many `grep` alternatives have been developed, including [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/), [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) and [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
All of them are fantastic and pretty much provide the same functionality.
For now I am sticking with ripgrep (`rg`), given how fast and intuitive it is. Some examples:
```bash
# Find all python files where I used the requests library
rg -t py 'import requests'
# Find all files (including hidden files) without a shebang line
rg -u --files-without-match "^#!"
# Find all matches of foo and print the following 5 lines
rg foo -A 5
# Print statistics of matches (# of matched lines and files )
rg --stats PATTERN
```

Note that as with `find`/`fd`, it is important that you know that these problems can be quickly solved using one of these tools, while the specific tools you use are not as important.

## Finding shell commands

So far we have seen how to find files and code, but as you start spending more time in the shell, you may want to find specific commands you typed at some point.
The first thing to know is that the typing up arrow will give you back your last command, and if you keep pressing it you will slowly go through your shell history.

The `history` command will let you access your shell history programmatically.
It will print your shell history to the standard output.
If we want to search there we can pipe that output to `grep` and search for patterns.
`history | grep find` will print commands that contain the substring "find".

In most shells, you can make use of `Ctrl+R` to perform backwards search through your history.
After pressing `Ctrl+R`, you can type a substring you want to match for commands in your history.
As you keep pressing it, you will cycle through the matches in your history.
This can also be enabled with the UP/DOWN arrows in [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search).
A nice addition on top of `Ctrl+R` comes with using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Configuring-shell-key-bindings#ctrl-r) bindings.
`fzf` is a general-purpose fuzzy finder that can be used with many commands.
Here is used to fuzzily match through your history and present results in a convenient and visually pleasing manner.

Another cool history-related trick I really enjoy is **history-based autosuggestions**.
First introduced by the [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell, this feature dynamically autocompletes your current shell command with the most recent command that you typed that shares a common prefix with it.
It can be enabled in [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and it is a great quality of life trick for your shell.

Lastly, a thing to have in mind is that if you start a command with a leading space it won't be added to your shell history.
This comes in handy when you are typing commands with passwords or other bits of sensitive information.
If you make the mistake of not adding the leading space, you can always manually remove the entry by editing your `.bash_history` or `.zhistory`.

## Directory Navigation

So far, we have assumed that you are already where you need to be to perform these actions. But how do you go about quickly navigating directories?
There are many simple ways that you could do this, such as writing shell aliases or creating symlinks with [ln -s](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html), but the truth is that developers have figured out quite clever and sophisticated solutions by now.

As with the theme of this course, you often want to optimize for the common case.
Finding frequent and/or recent files and directories can be done through tools like [`fasd`](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) and [`autojump`](https://github.com/wting/autojump).
Fasd ranks files and directories by [_frecency_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/The_Places_frecency_algorithm), that is, by both _frequency_ and _recency_.
By default, `fasd` adds a `z` command that you can use to quickly `cd` using a substring of a _frecent_ directory. For example, if you often go to `/home/user/files/cool_project` you can simply use `z cool` to jump there. Using autojump, this same change of directory could be accomplished using `j cool`.

More complex tools exist to quickly get an overview of a directory structure [`tree`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree), [`broot`](https://github.com/Canop/broot) or even full fledged file managers like [`nnn`](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) or [`ranger`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

# Exercises

1. Read [`man ls`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) and write an `ls` command that lists files in the following manner

    - Includes all files, including hidden files
    - Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)
    - Files are ordered by recency
    - Output is colorized

    A sample output would look like this

    ```
    -rw-r--r--   1 user group 1.1M Jan 14 09:53 baz
    drwxr-xr-x   5 user group  160 Jan 14 09:53 .
    -rw-r--r--   1 user group  514 Jan 14 06:42 bar
    -rw-r--r--   1 user group 106M Jan 13 12:12 foo
    drwx------+ 47 user group 1.5K Jan 12 18:08 ..
    ```

1. Write bash functions  `marco` and `polo` that do the following.
Whenever you execute `marco` the current working directory should be saved in some manner, then when you execute `polo`, no matter what directory you are in, `polo` should `cd` you back to the directory where you executed `marco`.
For ease of debugging you can write the code in a file `marco.sh` and (re)load the definitions to your shell by executing `source marco.sh`.

{% comment %}
marco() {
    export MARCO=$(pwd)
}

polo() {
    cd "$MARCO"
}
{% endcomment %}

1. Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming to get a failure run.
Write a bash script that runs the following script until it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints everything at the end.
Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail.

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))

    if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
       echo "Something went wrong"
       >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
       exit 1
    fi

    echo "Everything went according to plan"
    ```

{% comment %}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

count=0
until [[ "$?" -ne 0 ]];
do
  count=$((count+1))
  ./random.sh &> out.txt
done

echo "found error after $count runs"
cat out.txt
{% endcomment %}

1. As we covered in the lecture `find`'s `-exec` can be very powerful for performing operations over the files we are searching for.
However, what if we want to do something with **all** the files, like creating a zip file?
As you have seen so far commands will take input from both arguments and STDIN.
When piping commands, we are connecting STDOUT to STDIN, but some commands like `tar` take inputs from arguments.
To bridge this disconnect there's the [`xargs`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html) command which will execute a command using STDIN as arguments.
For example `ls | xargs rm` will delete the files in the current directory.

    Your task is to write a command that recursively finds all HTML files in the folder and makes a zip with them. Note that your command should work even if the files have spaces (hint: check `-d` flag for `xargs`)
    {% comment %}
    find . -type f -name "*.html" | xargs -d '\n'  tar -cvzf archive.tar.gz
    {% endcomment %}

1. (Advanced) Write a command or script to recursively find the most recently modified file in a directory. More generally, can you list all files by recency?
